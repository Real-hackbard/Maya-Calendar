The Maya calendar is a system of calendars used in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and in many modern communities in the Guatemalan highlands, [Veracruz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracruz), Oaxaca and [Chiapas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiapas), Mexico.

The essentials of the Maya calendar are based upon a system which had been in common use throughout the region, dating back to at least the 5th century BC. It shares many aspects with calendars employed by other earlier Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the Zapotec and Olmec and contemporary or later ones such as the [Mixtec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtec_culture) and [Aztec calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_calendar).

By the [Maya mythological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_mythology) tradition, as documented in Colonial Yucatec accounts and reconstructed from Late Classic and Postclassic inscriptions, the deity [Itzamna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itzamna) is frequently credited with bringing the knowledge of the calendrical system to the ancestral Maya, along with writing in general and other foundational aspects of Mayan culture.

# Tzolkʼin:  
The [tzolkʼin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin) (in modern Maya orthography; also commonly written tzolkin) is the name commonly employed by Mayanist researchers for the Maya Sacred Round or 260-day calendar. The word tzolkʼin is a neologism coined in [Yucatec Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucatec_Maya_language), to mean "count of days" (Coe 1992). The various names of this calendar as used by precolumbian Maya people are still debated by scholars. The [Aztec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztecs) calendar equivalent was called [Tōnalpōhualli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dnalp%C5%8Dhualli), in the Nahuatl language.

The tzolkʼin calendar combines twenty day names with the thirteen day numbers to produce 260 unique days. It is used to determine the time of religious and ceremonial events and for divination. Each successive day is numbered from 1 up to 13 and then starting again at 1. Separately from this, every day is given a name in sequence from a list of 20 day
